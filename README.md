# Keeper-App
Keeper App is a note-taking app developed with ReactJs.Keeper App is an app where we can store our daily thoughts, tasks, lists, etc. into a bunch of dynamically rendered small digital white notes. This app has been developed using ReactJS. Through this app I familiarized myself with the fundamentals of ReactJS like working with components, props, working with hooks, with different states, complex states and managing the component tree.
